        I am an informatics student at NTNU with passion for computer graphics. My interest started with augmented and virtual realities, but now it has evolved towards the graphics pipeline and computer vision as well. The more I explore, the more areas I find exciting to learn about. 

          <br><br>So far I have had the pleasure to have IT jobs in three companies. Those experiences have taught me a lot about what it is like to be a part of a bigger team in a real world. 

          <br><br>Now I am looking forward for my next and hopefully more long term team to be a part of when I am finished with my master's degree.

          <br><br>Feel free to reach out to me!
